ON LiMiT (Optimal Non-pharmacological Lifestyle Modifications in people
with Type 2 diabetes) is a large Danish intervention study investigating
the maintenance of remission of type 2 diabetes through weight loss,
diet, and exercise. The project runs from 2025 to 2030 and will involve
1,500 participants with type 2 diabetes.

Although the ON LiMiT study has been classified as not being a clinical
drug trial by the Danish Medical Agency (DMA), we have chosen to align
with best practices for clinical trials wherever possible. While a Data
Management Plan (DMP) is not mandatory for a study such as ON LiMiT, it
is strongly recommended for all research studies. This DMP ensures
transparency, compliance, and integrity in handling participant data
throughout the project lifecycle.

We follow a modified version of a DMP template from
[DeiC](https://deic.dk/en/data-management), mainly around how we
describe access to data.

## Collaborations

The project is being conducted in Aarhus, Odense, and Copenhagen and is
a collaboration between Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, Steno Diabetes
Center Odense, Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Bispebjerg Hospital,
and the Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports and the Center for
Basic Metabolic Research at the University of Copenhagen.

## Governance and maintenance

This document will be maintained by members of the study team and has
been approved for publication on the project website by the Project
Manager on behalf of the Chief Investigator.

## Funding

The project is funded by approximately DKK 102 million from the Novo
Nordisk Foundation (Grant Number NNF24SA0097844).
