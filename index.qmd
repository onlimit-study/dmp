This website contains the documentation for the design and architecture
of ON-LiMiT's data collection, processing, and storage. Mostly it
contains the [Data Management
Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management_plan) (DMP) for the
study.

We follow a modified version of a DMP template from
[DeiC](https://deic.dk/en/data-management), mainly around how we
describe access to data.
