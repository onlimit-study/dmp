# Changelog

Since we follow [Conventional
Commits](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-conventional-commits),
we're able to automatically create a release with
[Commitizen](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-semantic-release-with-commitizen)
based on the commit messages. This means that releases can happen quite
often, sometimes several in a day. It also means any individual release
will not have many changes within it. Below is a list of releases along
with what was changed within it.
