# Naming of files and variables

The purpose of this section is to ensure we follow a consistent and
systematic naming and description of our research data. A uniform
structure makes it easier to identify, understand, and analyse data
across visits and preparatory activities. It also supports correct
workflow configuration and contributes to data quality and traceability
in the study.

All names and descriptions must be written in UK English.

## Files

In general, a file uploaded either to REDCap or directly to GenomeDK
should contain:

-   The ID of the participant
-   The origin of the data (often a sensor or a scanner)
-   Which visit the data originates from
-   Which repeat of the test it shows (where relevant)

For example:

-   `3_v4_dxa.csv`: Participant 3, visit 4, DXA scanning

-   `3_v4-5_finapres.csv`: Participant 3, visit 4, run number 5 of the
    [finapres](https://www.finapres.com) scanning

::: {.callout-important title="Our naming rules"}

-   Use an underscore (`_`) to separate individual items (who, when,
    what).
-   Use a hyphen (`-`) to indicate multiple measurements at the same
    visit.
:::


## Variables

This section assumes REDCap is used for data collection. Instruments
(forms) contain fields for each variable, with both a field name and a
field annotation for descriptions.

The name of the forms (instruments) must indicate whether:

-   The form is used for preparation before a participant's visit, or
-   The form is used during a visit to record participant data.

All variable names and descriptions must indicate the visit to which
they belong. This should be specified:

-   At the end of the variable name (e.g., `_v1`, `_v2`, etc.), or

-   In the description (e.g., *Visit X*).

::: callout-tip
In REDCap you can use the Action Tag / Field Annotation section
(currently situated at the bottom left) to capture the variable
descriptions.
:::

### General requirements for all visits

Each visit must begin by recording:

-   Date of the visit
-   Initials for the project visit
-   Whether the participant is identified by name and CPR
-   Whether a relative is present
-   Who the relative is

It is important to use the same variable names for these items, only
changing the visit number as appropriate.

Each visit must end with:

-   A description of any points of attention prior to the next visit (if
    any)
-   A summary and general comments on the visit

::: callout-tip
In REDCap these can be copied from one visit to another, but ensure that
for instance `v1` / `visit 1` is updated to the correct visit number.
:::

### Distinction between visits and preparations

It is important to distinguish between:

-   Instruments/variables belonging to the actual visit
-   Instruments/variables related to preparations for the visit (These
    are mainly for internal workflows and practicalities)

### Naming conventions

-   Variables related to **preparations for a visit** must use the
    following format:

    `[descriptive_name]_wfvX` Example: bloodsamples_wfv1

    *(where `wfvX` stands for workflow visit X)*

-   Description for **preparations**:

    `Workflow. Preparations for visit X.` Example: Workflow.
    Preparations for visit 1

-   Description for **workflows during a visit**:

    `Workflow. Visit X.` Example: Workflow. Visit 1

## Describing variables

Action tags should follow a streamlined description, ideally including
the following elements:

-   **Who** the value belongs to (optional). Used only if it is not the
    participant (e.g., staff member)

-   **What** – What is being measured (mandatory) Provide a short and
    precise description of the measurement

-   **Unit** – Measurement unit (if relevant) e.g., kg, mmol/L, minutes

-   **Where/How** – Where or how it was measured (if possible) e.g.,
    “measured with digital scale”

-   **Visit** – Visit number (mandatory) Used to distinguish between
    repeated measurements and to place the variable on the study
    timeline

**Example:**

-   Participant's weight in kilograms, measured wearing light clothing
    using a digital scale. Measured to the nearest 0.1 kg. Visit 1.

| Category | Rule | Example |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **File Naming** | `[participantID]_v[visit]-[repeat]_[dataorigin].ext` | `3_v4_dxa.csv` or `3_v4-5_finapres.csv` |
| **Variable Naming** | `[descriptive_name]_vX` for visit data<br>`[descriptive_name]_wfvX` for workflow | `weight_v1`<br>`bloodsamples_wfv1` |
| **Visit Description** | Always include visit number in description | `Visit 1` |
| **Workflow Description** | Preparations: `Workflow. Preparations for visit X`<br>During visit: `Workflow. Visit X` | `Workflow. Preparations for visit 1`<br>`Workflow. Visit 1` |
| **Variable Description Elements** | Who (optional), What (mandatory), Unit (if relevant), Where/How (if possible), Visit (mandatory) | `Participant’s weight in kilograms, measured wearing light clothing using a digital scale. Measured to the nearest 0.1 kg. Visit 1.` |
