# Storage, Backup, and Access

<!--TODO Intro text-->

## Storage

<!--TODO Intro text-->

### GenomeDK (GDK)

GDK provides several storage areas. We will use the project storage in
their Open zone for the ON LiMiT project. These locations are designed
for collaborative data and are eligible for backup. We do not need a
Data Processing Agreement with GenomeDK as our host organisations AU and
AUH already have an agreement in place which will cover us.

### REDCap

REDCap is a secure web application for research databases and e‑forms.
It stores data in a postgres database and related files in a controlled
file area (“File Repository”). Aarhus University provides REDCap
facilities for both the University and Aarhus University Hospital
employees. The File Repository is intended for storing data and study
files, but it should not be the primary long‑term file storage for bulk
data; we will export and archive data into our primary storage (GDK)
using the API facility provided by REDCap. As with GDK we don't need a
Data Processing Agreement for the same reasons as above.

### LIVA

Liva Healthcare states compliance with GDPR and ISO/IEC 27001/27002 and
NHS Data Security & Protection standards on their
[website](https://www.livahealthcare.com). We understand that data is
being stored on AWS services that are physically based in Frankfurt,
Germany. The data will be made available to us via AWS on a ftp
connection on request, we hope to transfer the data directly to folders
on GDK, from where we will transform and load them into storage.

## Backup

<!--TODO Intro text-->

### GenomeDK

GDK runs its own disk‑based backup at a remote site. By default nothing
is backed up. There is guidance given on the GDK
[website](https://genome.au.dk/docs/working-with-data/#backup) which
details how the backup should be set up. It is the responsibility of the
individual study teams to set this up correctly, but help can be
requested from the GDK team (in particular to check that the folders
have been set up correctly).

Backups are initiated once per week and retained for 14 days and it is
possible to review recent backup runs, it is recommended that larger
files are kept out of the backup structure and only added in compressed
format. At present we don't believe that we will have any files that
require this, but it will be something that we will keep under
observation (see section on data volume).

What we back up: Raw data that cannot be reproduced, cleaned data in
parquet format, and metadata. Where we put things: We will put metadata
in data/metadata/ and project documentation in docs/, and we will mark
the appropriate parent directory with BACKUP so it is captured by GDK’s
weekly backup. As we do not expect to do any analysis in the main study
folder (see section on sharing data) we don't expect to be backing up
any analysis scripts or results here. This will be done in separate
project folders which will be set up to only back up scripts and
results.

### REDCap

<!--TODO check this once redcap is up again-->

### LIVA

Backups, retention, recovery, and export options are governed by
contract. The Liva contract draft should specify backup frequency,
encryption, location (EU/EEA), recovery time, and access/audit
reporting. We will confirm these parameters during contract finalization
and update this section once the contract is signed.

## Access

It should be a limited number of people who have access to the full set
of research data. Ideally the project manager and the data architect. In
the real world some members of staff from Steno will have access to the
data held on REDCap as they will be doing most of the design and setup
of instruments, and staff from the Seedcase project will have access to
data on GDK as they will be helping with the transformation of raw data
to parquet files, and the creation of metadata. It should be made clear
that no data analysis is to take place using the data without prior
approval from the Chief Investigator or the Project Manager. There will
also be staff at LIVA which will have access to their back-end data,
this is covered by the contract.

### GDK

Access is managed on a project folder basis. GDK maintains logs and
states it records login and file access events to help ensure GDPR
compliance. We have been informed that we will be receiving regular
reports from the system once we start using the site.

### REDCap

REDCap provides a Logging module that automatically records
project‑level activity (e.g., data exports, data changes, user
creation/deletion). We will review logs on a monthly basis and after any
major change. This will be done on the back of an automated email sent
out by REDCap encouraging project owners to check through their log
files and access controls.

### LIVA

We will rely on the Liva contract agreement for access control, audit
reporting cadence, and data‑sharing/export mechanisms. We expect that
Liva will be able to provide us with either access to a list of users
with data viewing access, or will be able to provide such a list on
demand.

<!--TODO check that REDCap promise to do backups and their frequency-->

<!--TODO Check if REDCap has any kind of access to data log-->

<!--TODO We should write down access guidelines to REDCap data, this should detail that data should not be accessed in order to do analysis without prior approval -->
