# Ethics, security, and legal compliance

Ethical and legal considerations, including related to security, are
central to responsible data management, particularly in health research
involving sensitive personal information. This section outlines how we
are planning to handle ethical standards, legal obligations, and data
security measures.

## Ethics and privacy

All participants will provide informed consent, which includes a clear
statement that their data will be retained for a minimum of 25 years.
The consent form also specifies that data may be shared with other
research institutions, but strictly for research purposes.

<!--TODO Check if consent form can be made publicly available. -->

To protect the privacy of our participant, personally identifiable data
(PID) will never be made available to researchers during the analysis
phase. PID will only be accessible to staff responsible for direct
participant contact, those managing instruments within REDCap, or for
managing the final data structure. For all analytical purposes,
anonymised data will be used. Requests for data extracts must be
submitted via a formal application form, which requires applicants to
justify their need for specific data points, especially if they involve
PID.

<!--TODO Make sure that the data access application form include a section stating that raw data must not be extracted from GenomeDK, and only results and scripts may be exported. -->

## Legal compliance

The project complies with all relevant legal obligations concerning data
handling and sharing. A data sharing agreement is in place between all
participating sites, enabling secure and lawful data exchange within the
main study and any sub-studies. Data from REDCap will be transferred to
GenomeDK (GDK) via a secure API. Data from LIVA will be made available
through an AWS FTP server and transferred directly to GDK. This should
ensure that we comply with all legal requirements.

## Data security

All data analysis will be conducted within the secure environment of
GenomeDK (with the exception of the work that will take place in the
secure environment at Statistics Denmark) . For each approved data
access request, a dedicated project folder will be created. Researchers
will be informed (via the data access application process) that raw data
must not be extracted from GDK and that only analysis results and
scripts may be exported. PID stored on GDK will be further protected
through encryption using standard scripts available within the platform.
If a study requires linkage with additional datasets from Statistics
Denmark, PID will only be used for secure transfer purposes and not for
direct analysis. Following the conclusion of the feasibility study, we
will evaluate whether to delete PID from REDCap or remove the entire
dataset. A similar process will be applied to the main study once all
data has been successfully transferred and verified on GDK.

Any suspected breaches of data security must and will be escalated
immediately to the relevant point of escalation at Aarhus University or
