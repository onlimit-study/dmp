# Introduction

It is recommended that all studies create a Data Management Plan (DMP), to help create an overview of the data that a study will generate, how it is handled and stored.

In the ON LiMiT study we've chosen to follow the guidance from [DEiC](www.deic.dk) with one or two small deviations (mainly around how we describe access to data).
