# Responsibilities and Resources
Effective data management relies to a great extent on clear guidelines as well as clear definitions of roles and responsibilities. By defining responsibilities and ensuring the right expertise and tools are in place, then data quality, compliance, and the long-term value of the projectâ€™s outputs should be ensured. This section outlines the key roles, and resources dedicated to managing data within the study.

## Responsibilities

### Data Management Roles
The project has appointed a dedicated Data Architect (DA) at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (SDCA) who holds primary responsibility for the overall data management strategy. This includes overseeing data capture, metadata production, data quality assurance, secure storage, backup and recovery procedures, long-term archiving, and data sharing. The DA will make sure that data flows are secure and well-documented.

### REDCap Setup and Study Team Contributions
While the DA is ultimately responsible for the setup and configuration of REDCap, much of the practical implementation will be carried out by a couple of members of the study team at Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen (SDCC). These team members will also contribute to identifying and describing specific data points registered in REDCap.

### Metadata and Documentation
Metadata will be generated using [Seedcase Sprout](), based on the data recorded in REDCap (for data registered there) and a data dictionary which will be developed in collaboration with the LIVA team as the study progresses (it remains to be determined what data points we will get from them). This will result in  metadata that is consistent, comprehensive, and aligned with FAIR principles.

### Long-term Data Handling and Storage
The DA is also responsible for overseeing the work carried out by the Seedcase team in converting raw data into parquet files for long-term storage. It is essential that this process preserves the integrity of the original data, and the DA will ensure that no information is lost or altered during the conversion.

### Sub-study Data Integration
Any sub-study that generates data is expected to submit its dataset in full to the main project, accompanied by appropriate metadata. Although the SDCA team is not responsible for collecting this data, the DA and the Project Manager (PM) share responsibility for ensuring that sub-study teams understand their obligations. This includes verifying that all relevant data is submitted to the main study and properly integrated into the central repository on GenomeDK.
