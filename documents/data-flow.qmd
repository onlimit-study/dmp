title: "Data Flows"
---

Below is a data flow diagram for the ON LiMiT project. The diagram
illustrates the flow of data between various components of the study,
including participants, healthcare professionals, and data management
systems.

At present the diagram is a work in progress, and will be updated as the
pilot study progresses. Most data will originate from the participants,
who will enter data into various apps and systems. The healthcare
professionals will also enter data into the system, and the lab staff
will collect and analyse biological samples from the participants. Much
of the data will be collated in a REDCap database before being uploaded
to the GenomeDK HPC facility for further processing.

Underneath the diagram is a more detailed description of the components
and their interactions.

## REDCap

REDCap is a secure web application for building and managing online
surveys and databases. It is used to collect data from participants and
healthcare professionals in the ON LiMiT project. REDCap will have two
main functions, the first is to collect data from clinicians and
participants via forms and questionnaires, and the second is to collate
data from other systems, likely through APIs or csv uploads.

## iMotions Food Preference

iMotion Food Preference is a system that tracks the eye movements of
participants when they are looking at pictures of food. The data
collected by this system can be pulled out as csv files and uploaded to
the REDCap database or directly to the GenomeDK HPC facility.

## SENS

SENS is an activity monitor that will be placed on the study
participants for a week. The data collected by a SENS device will be
extracted at clinic visits and the data will be uploaded to the REDCap
database. The SENS device will track the participants' physical activity
levels in selected weeks of the study.

## Libre

Libre is a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor from Abbott that
will be worn by the participants for a week. The data collected by the
Libre device will be extracted at clinic visits and uploaded to the
REDCap database. The Libre device will track the participants' glucose
levels in selected weeks of the study.

## Liva

Liva is a mobile app that will be used by the participants to track
their physical activity (via Withings or Garmin activity watch),
adherence to the assigned diet intervention (via short diet screener),
body weight (via Withings or Gamin scale), answer other small
questionnaires, follow the study schedule and interact with study
personnel via a chat function. The app will likely connect to the REDCap
database via an API, allowing the data to be automatically uploaded to
the database.

### Withings or Garmin Watch and Scales

The Withings or Garmin Watch and Scales will be used by the participants
to track their physical activity and weight. The data collected by these
devices will be transmitted to the Monsenso app where it will be
collated and then uploaded to the REDCap database. The watch will track
the participants' physical activity levels, while the scales will track
their weight.
