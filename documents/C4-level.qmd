title: "C4 Models"
---

This section contains the [C4 Models](https://c4model.com/) for ON LiMiT data infrastructure.
Even though the C4 model is primarily used for software architecture, we use it here to describe the data infrastructure and its components. We will use the first two levels of the C4 model, the Context and Container diagrams, to describe the data infrastructure and its components.

## Context

ON LiMiT is a research project that collects data from various sources, including biological samples, questionnaires, and other electronic data. The data is collected from participants in the study, healthcare professionals, and bioanalysts. The data is stored on GenomeDKs servers and will be made available for researchers to analyze.
The following diagram shows the context of ON LiMiT, including the main users and data providers.

## Container

The Container diagram shows the main components of the ON LiMiT data infrastructure, including data sources, storage, and analysis tools. It provides an overview of how the data is collected, stored, and made available for analysis.
