# Documentation and Metadata

Clear and comprehensive documentation is essential to ensure that the
data collected during the study is both findable, usable, and reusable
not only today but also in five years time. This section outlines the
approach to documenting all datasets and associated metadata, including
the tools, standards, and processes that will be applied. By maintaining
detailed descriptions of variables, data sources, and collection
methods, and by implementing robust metadata management practices, we
want to support data integrity, making it easier to use the data, and
comply with FAIR principles.

## Documentation

All data stored on the GenomeDK servers will be generated during the
study, either by study staff or directly by participants. No external
datasets (such as national registers) will be stored within the ON LiMiT
environment. The primary sources of data include:

-   Participant input via the Liva Healthcare app and responses to
    questionnaires.
-   Medical devices and scanners, which will produce structured data
    files. A detailed list of scanners and devices will be maintained as
    part of the technical documentation.
-   Additional sensors and site-level data collection, uploaded as CSV
    files by study staff.

Data generation will occur throughout the two-year participation period
for each individual. While there are plans to link study data with
register data, this work will take place on Statistics Denmark's
servers. Access to the data will be strictly controlled through
GenomeDK. Researchers must submit an application to the Publications
Panel to gain access, ensuring transparency and governance.

<!--TODO Do we want to publish the publications guidance somewhere, and if so, do we want to link it here-->

## Metadata Strategy

To ensure data usability and interoperability, comprehensive metadata
will be created and maintained throughout the study:

<!--TODO Consider if this should be changed from a list to heading 3-->

-   Field-Level Documentation: Detailed variable descriptions has been
    written using the Field Annotation functionality in REDCap. This
    includes adherence to naming conventions defined by internal rules.

    <!--TODO Check with Anne-Ditte if they are happy for those guidelines to be made public-->

-   Supplier Data Dictionaries: All external data providers (e.g., Liva
    Healthcare, MyFood24) will supply data dictionaries in CSV format.
    These will be integrated into the metadata repository by the data
    architect.

-   Device and Sensor Data: CSV files originating from scanners and
    sensors will be documented collaboratively by site staff and the
    data architect to ensure completeness and clarity.

-   Metadata Packaging: The Seedcase Sprout software will be used to
    generate and store metadata in a standardized data package format.
    These packages will be stored alongside the corresponding datasets
    on GenomeDK, ensuring location and version control.

    <!--TODO Get Luke to re-write the Packaging bit-->

## Versioning and Updates

Metadata will be treated as a living resource. Updates will occur
whenever new variables are introduced, existing fields are modified, or
additional data sources are integrated. Version control will be
implemented through Seedcase Sprout, ensuring that:

-   Each metadata package is assigned a unique version identifier.
-   Changes are logged with timestamps and descriptions.
-   Previous versions remain accessible for audit and reproducibility
    purposes.

This approach guarantees traceability and supports long-term data
integrity.

## Data Discovery and Accessibility

To facilitate data discovery, a dedicated website will be developed.
This site will provide:

-   A searchable catalog of all variables.
-   Clear descriptions and metadata for each variable.
-   A foundation for the Publications Panel application process,
    ensuring researchers can identify relevant data before requesting
    access.

This approach guarantees that data is well-documented, discoverable, and
compliant with FAIR principles.
